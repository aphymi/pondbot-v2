Running
------

In order to run PondBot, use `./manage.py run` or `./manage.py keep`.

The latter runs the bot while keeping access to stdin and stdout, while the former runs the bot and detaches
    from the process, freeing up the terminal.

Before the first run, use './manage.py make-configs' to generate the default configs.
